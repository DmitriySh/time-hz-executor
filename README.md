time-hz-executor
=======
    
My pet project.  
This is a prototype of multithreaded and distributed service executes incoming tasks on a scheduled time. Powered by: `Java SE`, `Guice` and `Hazelcast`. Project uses SEDA like highly customizable thread model: independent tasks to use producers, consumers and queue, distributed map between them.
  
  
## Rules:  

![export-2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4469702/24129401/85e05708-0df3-11e7-8dd0-17f8bbb1e12e.png)

  * The cluster of Hazelcast nodes accepts tasks with `LocalDateTime` and `Callable<?>`. 
  * `LocalDateTime` is a scheduled time and `Callable<?>` is a task for execution on that time.
  * Order of the execution uses scheduled time or number of inbound order.
  * Tasks could comes in a random order
  * 'Hot' tasks should not waste time and executes immediately.

  
## Requirements:

  * Java SE Development Kit 8 (or newer)  
  * Gradle 2.x (or you could use Gradle wrapper)  


## Project configuration:  

  * Java SE should be installed and you need to set path variable for `JAVA_HOME`.
  * Gradle doesn't need to install because you might do this automatically thanks Gradle Wrapper.


## Run

  *  Build project. Go to the root path `/time-hz-executor/` of the project and run:  
```sh
time-hz-executor$ ./gradlew clean build

## Stop

  * First choice for the client `time-hz-executor` is terminated in response to a user interrupt, such as typing `^C` (Ctrl + C), or a system-wide event of shutdown.  
```sh

... <cut> ...

^CClient: 1 STOP 2017-03-21T06:15:23.772
Buy!
Client: 1 stopped, state: IDLE

```  
  * Second choice is to use inner command line
```sh

... <cut> ...

ConsoleClient: Client get ready, choose command... (/h - help)
/h
	h - help
	You see current message

	s - send <local_date_time_pattern>:<yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm> <message>:<string>
	You send the text message at the scheduled time to execute on Hazelcast node

	q - quit
	End session and quit

	t - utc
	Get current Hazelcast cluster time in UTC
